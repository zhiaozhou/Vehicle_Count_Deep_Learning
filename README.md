Description
=====
This project is aimed to calculate the traffic density on a fixed range of road by counting the number of vehicles in an image which is done manually now by NYC DOT. So now people cannot directly calculate the traffic density. However, we think of a way to do it using Convolutional Neural Network and even newly published CapsNet which failed finally.

We finally decided to do it by finetuning the Google Inception_Resnet_v2 model by using our own datasets.
