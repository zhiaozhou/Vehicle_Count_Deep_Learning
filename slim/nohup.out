WARNING:tensorflow:From train_image_classifier.py:410: create_global_step (from tensorflow.contrib.framework.python.ops.variables) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

WARNING:tensorflow:From train_image_classifier.py:476: softmax_cross_entropy (from tensorflow.contrib.losses.python.losses.loss_ops) is deprecated and will be removed after 2016-12-30.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.losses.softmax_cross_entropy instead. Note that the order of the logits and labels arguments has been changed.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /home/paperspace/anaconda3/envs/fastai/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/contrib/losses/python/losses/loss_ops.py:398: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2.
